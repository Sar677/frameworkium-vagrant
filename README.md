====================

Start up an Ubuntu VM with all the dependencies required for using [Frameworkium](https://github.com/robertgates55/frameworkium) in 5 easy steps:

2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
3. ``` git clone https://github.com/robertgates55/frameworkium-vagrant.git ```
4. ``` cd frameworkium-vagrant/ ```
5. ``` vagrant up ``` (grab a coffee, this may take a short while)
6. Once ``` vagrant up ``` has finished login on the VM as vagrant, password: vagrant

- Eclipse, Maven, Git, Firefox, Chrome, chrome-driver and PhantomJS are all installed and ready to use
- Frameworkium is checked out in /home/vagrant/frameworkium
